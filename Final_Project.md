# Final Project: Applying Generative AI Concepts

## Objective
The goal of this final project is to encourage students to apply the knowledge and skills they have learned throughout the course related to generative AI, including using models such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models. Students will conceptualize, create, and present a project that demonstrates their understanding and innovative application of the course material.

## Project Overview
Students will form small groups (3-4 members) and choose one of the following project options or propose their own based on concepts covered in the course:

### Project Options
1. **AI Art Generation**  
   Create a program that uses a diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) to generate original artwork from text prompts. Document the process of selecting prompts and evaluating the creativity and quality of the generated images.

2. **Text-to-Image Synthesis**  
   Develop a model that translates descriptive text into corresponding images. Utilize GANs and include an explanation of how the models and datasets were chosen.

3. **Interactive Chatbot**  
   Design an AI chatbot that communicates with users and generates responses based on a predefined set of tasks using Language Models (LLMs). Include functionalities such as logging interactions and improving responses through user feedback.

4. **Deepfake Technology**  
   Create a video or image manipulation project that showcases the capabilities of deepfake technology using a Pix2Pix GAN model. Discuss the ethical implications and potential misuse of this technology.

5. **A Comparative Study**  
   Conduct a comparative analysis of various generative models (GANs vs. VAEs vs. diffusion models). Highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model for specific tasks (e.g., image generation vs. text generation).

## Deliverables
- **Written Report**: A detailed report (8-10 pages) documenting the project. This report should include:
  - Introduction to the chosen project type
  - Methodology: Detailed explanation of the models used, the data collection process, and implementation steps.
  - Results: Presentation of the generated content (images, chat logs, etc.), including visual examples and evaluations.
  - Discussion: Insights on the experience, challenges faced, and potential improvements or future work.
  - References: List of academic and other sources consulted during the project.

- **Presentation**: A 15-minute presentation showcasing the project to the class. This should cover:
  - Project overview and objectives
  - Demonstration of the AI application or results
  - Key learnings and insights from the project process.

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Project teams formed and project topics chosen.
- **Week 2-3**: Research and model development.
- **Week 4**: Initial report draft due for peer review.
- **Week 5**: Final report submission and presentations.

## Assessment Criteria
- **Understanding of Concepts**: Depth of understanding and application of generative AI concepts.
- **Innovation**: Creativity and originality in project approach.
- **Execution and Presentation**: Quality of final outputs, clarity of the written report and effectiveness of the presentation.
- **Collaboration**: Functionality and dynamics of the team throughout the project.
